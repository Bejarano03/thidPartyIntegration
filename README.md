## Description

This application request random anime quotes from the Animechan API.
It does a simple job in displaying the quote. 

## Installation

1. Clone to local enviroment
1. Install necessary modules
1. npm start on console
1. Go to localhost:3000/ and refresh the page for new quotes

## Down the Line

I would like to incorporate some more styling measure to add a bold and italic look.
Centering the quote would not hurt either.
